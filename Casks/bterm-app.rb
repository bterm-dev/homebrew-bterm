# bterm desktop app (term-app GUI) as a Homebrew Cask. The .app bundles

  # The .app is ad-hoc signed (no Apple Developer ID / notarization yet),

  # download is present. Strip it on install. NOTE: recent macOS dropped
  # `xattr -r`, so walk the bundle with find instead.

    The app is ad-hoc signed (not notarized). If macOS still blocks it:

    Link this machine for remote control with:
