# bterm desktop app (term-app GUI) as a Homebrew Cask. The .app bundles
# the daemon, so a GUI-only install still works offline; `brew install
# bterm-dev/bterm/bterm` (the formula) remains the CLI/TUI suite.

# Updated by bterm-core/scripts/update-brew-formula.sh on each release.

  # The .app is ad-hoc signed (no Apple Developer ID / notarization yet),
  # so Gatekeeper refuses to open it while the quarantine xattr from the
  # download is present. Strip it on install. NOTE: recent macOS dropped
  # `xattr -r`, so walk the bundle with find instead.

    The app is ad-hoc signed (not notarized). If macOS still blocks it:
