# bterm Homebrew formula (D2). Installs the FULL CLI suite — bterm (CLI),
# bterm-serverd (daemon), bterm-login, term-tui — from the binaries-only
# releases repo, so installing the TUI always installs the daemon (D4).
#
# Updated by bterm-core/scripts/update-brew-formula.sh on each release
# (rewrites `version`, urls and sha256s from the release's SHA256SUMS).
