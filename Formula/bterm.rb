# bterm Homebrew formula. Installs the CLI suite — bterm (CLI/TUI launcher),
# bterm-daemon-v13 (the v13 daemon), term-tui (the UI bterm execs) — from the
# binaries-only releases repo, so installing the CLI always installs the daemon.
#
# Updated by bterm-core/scripts/update-brew-formula.sh on each release
# (rewrites `version`, urls and sha256s from the release's SHA256SUMS).

      Link this machine to your bterm account:
        bterm login
      Then start the daemon (the CLI/app also auto-start it):
        bterm daemon start
      Manage your terminals from anywhere at https://app.bterm.dev
